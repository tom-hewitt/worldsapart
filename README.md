# Worlds Apart
A low-poly 3D space game featuring procedurally generated planets, a custom physics engine, and distributed server architecture, winning the [StudentHack Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/worlds-apart-01e5gj).

## Inspiration
Inspired by the captivating low-poly art style for space and the potential of procedurally generated planets, we set out to create a visually stunning 3D game where little astronauts explore vibrant, low-poly worlds. Our goal was to bring this space fantasy to life with a unique and engaging experience.

## What It Does
Worlds Apart offers players an immersive space adventure where they can join dynamically generated worlds using unique game codes. The game features a server infrastructure that manages player connections and waiting rooms efficiently. Players crash-land on various planets, collect items to repair their ship, and explore spherical planets with custom gravity physics.

## How We Built It
- **Server Architecture**: Developed a novel server meshing system to support large player counts. New servers are dynamically created for different space regions.
- **Client-Side Prediction**: Implemented client-side prediction to enhance networking performance, ensuring a smooth experience even on slower connections.
- **Custom Physics Engine**: Built a custom physics engine to handle the unique gravitational forces of small, spherical planets.
- **Modeling and Animation**: Used Blender to create custom models and animations, and integrated them into the game with a three.js-based rendering system and animated state machines for characters.

## Built With
- **3js**
- **Blender**
- **GitHub**
- **GLSL**
- **Next.js**
- **Partykit**
